This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
##Peer Assignment1 Reproducible Research

###Read CSV file from working directory

```{r}
active <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

###veiw column names and data from first 6 rows
```{r}
head(active)
```
###To find the mean number of steps per day first remove missing data, sum the the remainig data then calculate the mean.
```{r}
#subset complete data 
actComplete <- active[complete.cases(active),]

#calulate daily sum of steps
sumSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, actComplete, sum)

#rename sum of steps 
names(sumSteps)[2] <- "dailySteps"

#veiw column names and first six rows
head(sumSteps)

#plot histogram
hist(
        sumSteps$dailySteps,
        col = "red",
        main = "Histogram of daily total steps",
        xlab = "Total Number of steps",
        breaks = 10
)

#calculate mean steps
mean(sumSteps$dailySteps)
#calculate median steps
median(sumSteps$dailySteps)
```

###Calculate mean number of steps tahen per day then plot time series of mean steps taken per day versus interval. Calculate the interval with the maximum number of steps.

```{r}
meanSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, actComplete, mean)

names(meanSteps)[2] <- "averageSteps"

head(meanSteps)

plot(
        x = meanSteps$interval,
        y = meanSteps$averageSteps,
        type = "l",
        main = "Time Series Plot of the average number of steps versus 5 minute interval",
        xlab = "5 minute intervals",
        ylab = "Average number of steps"
)

meanSteps[meanSteps$averageSteps==max(meanSteps$averageSteps),]
```

###Calculate the number of missing values, replace missing values with the mean and create a new dataset without any missing variables.Plot a histogram with new mean number of steps for imputed data then re-calculate the mean and median

```{r}
nrow(active[is.na(active$steps),])

#create file to impute data
actImpute<-active

#impute data, replace na with mean
actImpute$steps[is.na(actImpute$steps)] <- round(mean(actImpute$steps, na.rm = TRUE))

#check number of rows with missing data to ensure imputation was successful  
nrow(actImpute[is.na(actImpute$steps),])

#calulate daily sum of steps for imputed data
sumSteps2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, actImpute, sum)

#rename sum of steps 
names(sumSteps2)[2] <- "dailySteps"

#veiw column names and first six rows
head(sumSteps2)

#plot histogram
hist(
        sumSteps2$dailySteps,
        col = "red",
        main = "Histogram of daily total steps",
        xlab = "Total Number of steps",
        breaks = 10
)

#calculate mean steps for imputed data
mean(sumSteps2$dailySteps)

median(sumSteps2$dailySteps)
```
###Differentiate between weekdays and weekends then plot time series data comparing mean steps on weekdays and weekends

```{r}
actWeek<-actImpute

weekend <- weekdays(as.Date(actWeek$date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")

actWeek$weekday_or_weekend <- "weekday"

actWeek$weekday_or_weekend[weekend == TRUE] <- "weekend"

actWeek$weekday_or_weekend <- as.factor(actWeek$weekday_or_weekend)

head(actWeek)

str(actWeek)

meanStepsW <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + weekday_or_weekend, actWeek, mean)

names(meanStepsW)[3] <- "averageStepsW"

head(meanStepsW)

library(lattice)

xyplot(
        averageStepsW ~ interval | weekday_or_weekend,
        meanStepsW,
        type = "l",
        layout = c(1,2),
        main = "Time Series Plot of the average number of steps versus 5 minute interval for weekday and weekends",
        xlab = "5 minute interval",
        ylab = "Average Number of Steps"
)
```
